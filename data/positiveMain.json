It is contained in His words (exalted be He): I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt (Ex 20:2). At the end of Tractate Makkoth it is said: 'Six hundred and thirteen (Taryag) Commandments were declared unto Moses at Sinai, as the verse says, Moses commanded us a law (Torah)'; that is, he commanded us to observe as many Commandments as are signified by the sum of the letter-numbers TORAH. To this it was objected that the letter-numbers of the word TORAH make only six hundred and eleven; to which the reply was: 'The tow Commandments 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.' and 'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me we heard from the Almighty Himself'. Thus it has been made clear to yu that the verse, 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.', is one of the 613 Commandments, and is that whereby we are commanded to believe in God, as we have explained."

This injunction is contained in His words (exalted be He), Hear O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One (Deut 6:4). In most Midrashim you will find this explained as meaning that we are to declare the Unity of God's Name, or the Unity of God, or something of that kind. The intention of the Sages was to teach that God brought us out of Egypt and heaped kindness upon us only on condition that we believe in His Unity, which is our bounded duty. The Commandment to believe in God's Unity is mentioned in many places, and the Sages also call it the Commandment to believe in the Kingdom of HEaven, for they speak of the obligation 'to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven', that is to say, to declare God's Unity and to believe in Him."

    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to love God(exalted be He); that it to say, to dwell upon and contemplate His Commandments, His injunctions, and His works, so that we may obtaine a conception of Him, and in conveiving Him atain absolute joy. This constitutes the Love of God, and it obligatory. As the Sifre says: 'Since it is said, And thou shall love the Lord thy God (Deut 6:5), the question arises, how is one to manifest his love for the Lord? Scripture therefore says: And these words which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart (Deut 6:6); for through this [i.e. the contemplation of God's words] you will learn to discern Him whose word called the Universe in to existance.' We have thus made it clear to you that through this act of contemplation you will attain a conception of God and reach that stage of joy in which loveof Him will follow of necessity. The Sages say that this Commandment also includes an obligation to call upon all mankind to serve Him (exalted be He), and to have faith in Him. For just as you praise and extol anybody whom you love, and call upon others also to love him, so, if you love the Lord to the extent of the conception of His true nature to which you have attained, you will undoubtedly call upon the foolish and ignorant to seek knowledge of the Torah which you have already acquired. As the Sifre says: 'And thou shalt love the Lord they God: this means that you should make Him belovedof man as Abraham your father did, as it said, 'And the souls they had gotten in Haran (Genesis 12).' That is to say, just as Abraham, being a lover of the Lord - as Scripture testifies, AbrahamMy friend(Isa 41:8) - by the power of his conception of God, and out of his great love for Him, summon mankind unto Him.

This injunction is contained in His words, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God.(Deut 6:13). The Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin discusses the verse, he that blasphemeth (nokeb) the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death (Lev 24:16): 'Perhaps the word nokeb should be taken to mean 'pronounceth' [rather than 'blasphemeth'], as we find elsewhere, The men that were pronounced (nikebu) by name (Num 1:17), the [requisite] admonition being derived from the verse, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God? That is to say, the verse, he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, etc., might be understood as meaning one who merely mentions the Name of the Lord, without committing blasphemy; and if you ask  'What son is there in that ?' we reply that such a one abandons the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord not to pronounce His Name in vain. The Sages answer this question, and refute the view involved in it, as follows: 'First, in order to constitute blasphemy the Name must be used [in such a way that it might be represented as both the agent and the object of the blasphemy], and in this instance [of merely pronouncing the Name] the condition is absent'; that is to say, [the accused] must be guilty of blaspheming the Name [ of the Lord] in [His own] Name, just as [the Sages] say [by substitution], 'Let Jose smite Jose'. 'Moreover, the admonition you cite is  in the form of a Positive Commandment, and it is an accepted principle that such an admonition is invalid.' That is to say, your suggestion that a prohibition against the mere pronouncing of the Name of God can be derived from the verse, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, is inadmissible, because that verse is a Positive Commandment, and a prohibition cannot be based upon a Positive Commandment. Thus it has been made clear to you that the words, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, lay down a Positive Commandment."

Although this Commandment is of the class of General Precepts which are excluded from the 613 Commandments under the Fourth Principle, it none the less imposes a specific duty, viz. that of Prayer. The Sifre says: 'to serve Him means Prayer'.The Sages also say: 'to serve Him means study of the Law.' In the Mishnah of R. Eliezer, the son of R.

This injunction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And to Him shall thou cleave(Deut 10:20), which are repeated in the verse, And to cleave unto Him(Deut 11:22). The Sifre says: 'And to cleave unto Him means that we should cleave to wise men and to their disciples'. The Sages also use the words 'to Him thou shall cleave' as proof that it is one's duty to marry a wise man's daughter, to give one's own daughter in marriage to a wise man, to confer benefits on wise men and to have business relationships with them. 'Is it possible', they say, 'for a man to cleave to the Divine Presence, seeing that it is written, For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire(Deut 4:24)?'

This injunction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And by His Name shall thou swear(Deut 6:13, Deut 10:20), in explanation of which the Sages say: 'The Torah says By His name shall thou swear, and again, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain(Ex 20:7, Deut 10:20). Just as we are forbidden to take an oath for which there is no necesity, and this is a Negative Commandment(Neg. Comm 62), so we are commanded to take an oath when necessary, and this is a Positive Commandment. It is for this reason that it is not permissible to swear by any created object, such as the angels or the stars, save only where the oath is elliptical: as, for instance, where one swears by the truthof the sun, meaning 'by the truth of the God of the sun'. It is in this manner that our nation swears by the name of Moses our Teacher - honoured be his name - as though he who swears were to say 'by the God of Moses', or 'by Hom who sent Moses'. But whenever the one who swears does not mean it so, but swears by a created object, in the belief that that object has in itself such truth that one can swear by it, he transgresses by placing some other object on an equal footing with the Name of Heaven: and on this Tradition says: 'He who places the Name of Heaven on an equal footing with some other object shall be uprooted from the world.' This was the meaning intended by the verse, By His name shalt thou swear: To Him alone shalt thou in faith ascribe the truth by which it is proper to swear. It is said at the beginning of Tractate Temurah: 'Whence do we learn that we my bind ourselves with an oath to perform the Commandments? From the verse, And by His name shalt thou swear.' "

The purpose of this Commandment is that we are duty bound to proclaim this true religion to the world, undeterred by fear of injury from any source. Even if a tyrant tries to compel us by force to deny Him, we must not obey, but must positively rather submit to death; and we must not even mislead the tyrant into supposing that we have denied Him whicle in our hearts we continue to belivein Him(exalted be He). This is the Commandment concerning the Sanctification of the Name which is laid upon every son of Isreal: that we must be ready to die at the tyrant's hands for our love of Him(exalted be He), and for our faith in His unity, even as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah did in the time of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, when he forced people to prostate themselves before the idol, and all did so, the Israelites included, and ther was none there to sanctify the Name of Heaven, all being in terror. This ws a sore disgrace to Israel, in that this Commandment was disregarded by them all, and there was none to fulfill it, all being afraid. This Commandment applies only in circumstance such as those of that great occasion, when the whole world was in terror, and it was a duty to decalre His Unity publicly at that time. The Lord had already promised through Isaiah that Israel would not be completely disgraced on that hard occasion, but young men would appear among them, undeterred by death, and would sacrifuce their lives and proclaim the Faith, sancrtifying the Name publicly, as He commanded us through Moses our Teacher. This promise is in the words, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale; when he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, that they sanctify My name(Isa 29:22-23). The Sifre say: 'On this condition I bought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye sanctify My name publicly(Lev 22:32). The Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin says: 'Is a Noachid commanded to sanctify His Name or not? Listen to this: 'The Noachids were commanded to observe seven Commandments; but if they were [also] commanded to sanctify His Name, there are eight. Thus it has been made clear to you that this is one of the Commandments that are obligatory upon Israel, the Sages having deduced this Commandment from the words, I will be hallowed among the children of Israel.

This Commandment is repeated four times [in Scripture](Ex. 13:1; Ex. 13:16; Deut. 6:8; Deut. 11:18). The proof that the Phylactery of the Head and the Phylactery of the Arm are two [distinct] Commandments we find in the Genara, where the sages express surpise at the opinion that the Phylactery of the Head and the Phylactery of the Arm cannot be worn one without the other, but only when the two are together. 'If', they say , 'one cannot fulfil two Commandments, is he not to fulfil one? That is to say, if one cannot perform two Commandments must he perform neither of them? No: he should fulfil the one which he is able to fulfil. Thus [in the case under discussion] he should wear whichever phylactery he has. Thus it has been made clear to you that the Sages called the Phylactery of the Arm and the Phylactery of the Head two [distinct] Commandments. These two Commandments are not obligatory upon women, for in explanation of their obligatory character He has said, (exalted be He), That the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth(Ex.13.9), and women are not under obligation to study the Torah. This is the explanation given in the Mechilta. All the detailed rules of these two Commandments are set out in the fouth chapter of Menahoth. NOTE Seven rings, symbolizing the seven branches of the Candlestick, asre coild in a descending spiral around the forearm, and three rings, symbolic of Israel's spiritual betrothal to the Lord, are wound around the middle finger, the ensuing ring formations around the back and palm of the hand culminating once again in the Name Shadai. Three Commandments in the Torah are designated by the term oth - 'a sign' - between the Creator and Israel His people: Circumcision, the Sabbath, and the Tefillin or Phylacteries(Gen. 17:11; Ex. 31:13; Ex. 13:9).

This is not counted as two Commandments, although it is the rule with us that[the absence of] the blue[thread in the Fringes] does not impair the validity of the white, not does [the absence of] the white [threads] impair the validity of the blue(In each Fringe there should be seven white threads and one blue). The reason is given in the Sifre: One might think that these are two Commandments - the Commandment of the blue and the Commandment of the white; Scripture therefore states, And it shall be unto you for a fringes(Num. 15:39), thus showing that it is one Commandment and not two. This Commandment is not obligatory upon women, as explained at the beginning of Kiddushin. All its provisions are explained in Menahoth. NOTE The function of the thread of blue in the Fringes was expressed by Rabbi Meir in the folling words: 'Why was the colour blue chosen from all the other colours?

The conclusion reached at the end of the discussion is: 'One cannot argue from a general rule' [affecting a given class of Commandments as to its applicability to any and every specific Commandment]. Thus we see that the Sages regard the Assembly as the object of a Positive Commandment.

If he cannot write it himself, he is obliged to purchase one, or to hire[a scribe] who will write it for him. This injunction is expressed in His words(exlated be He), Now therefore write ye this song for you(Deut 31:19).' Now since it is not permissible to write[a Scroll of the Law containing only] certain sections of it, it follows of necessity that the words 'this song' mean the whole of the Torah which includes 'this song'. The Gemara of Sanhedrin says: 'Rabah said: Even if one's parents have left him a Scroll of the Law, he is nevertheless commanded to write one of his own, as it is said, Now therefore write ye this song for you. Abaye objected: the King is commanded to write a Scroll of the LAw for himself, for he should not seek credit for one wrtitten by others, and[this surely implies that] it is only a King [who is enjoined to write a Scroll even if his parents have left him one], and not a commoner? To this the reply was: The rule is necessary only to oblige the King to write two Scrolls, as we have been taight: he[the King] shall write him a copy(Deut 17:18, the Hebrew word translated 'a copy' means literally 'a repetition'.) of the law means that he is to write for himself two copies.

This injuction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And let them make Me a sanctuary(Ex.25:8). The Sifre says: 'The Israelites were obliged to fulfil three Commandments upon their entry into the Land: to appoint a king over themselves, to build the Sanctuary, and to annihilate the offspring of Amalek(Deut. 17:15). Thus it has been made clear to you that the building of the Sanctuary is a distinct Commandment in itself. We have already explained that this general injunction includes particular precepts, and that the Candlestick, the Table, the Altar, and the other [vessels and appurtenances] are all parts of the Sanctuary, and all together are called 'the Sanctuary', although there is a specific regulation for each and every part. It is true that He has said with regard to the Altar, an altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me(Ex.20:21), so that one might suppose this to be an independent, apart from the Commandment to build the Temple; but the true state of the case is as I will explain to you. The literal sense of the verse refers to the time when High Places were permitted to us, and we were allowed to make an Altar of earth in any place, and to offer sacrifices on it: and the Sages already declared that the purpose of the verse was to command us to build an Altar attached to the earth, which would not be movable as it had been in the desert(Num. 4:14; Ex.27:7). This was said by them in the Mechilta of Rabbi Ishmael, where the verse is thus interpreted: 'When you enter the Land you are to make unto Me an altar attached to the ground.' This being so, the Commandment[about the building of the Altar] is one which is binding for all time, relating to one of the parts of the Temple - that is to say, the verse in its entirety(Ex.20:21-22) means that the altar to be built must be of stone. The Mechilta, explaining the words, And if thou make Me an altar of stone(Ex.20:20-22), says: 'Rabbi Ishmael says: Every if in the Torah implies permission, except in three instances, one of which is And if thou make Me an altar of stone.' Thereon the Sages said: 'And if thou make Me an altar of stone establishes an obligation. You maintain this to be an obligation; perhaps it is only permissive? Scripture therefore says, Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of unhewn stones(Deut. 27:6; Ex.20:22). [This proves it to be obligatory, and not merely permissive: so the Commandment relating to the Altar is only a part of the Commandment to build the Temple]. The provisions of this Commandment as a whole, that is to say, thise relating to the building of the Sanctuary, its design and its divisions, the building of the Altar, and the relative laws, are explained in a Tractate specially devoted to the subject, namely Tractate Middoth. In like manner the design of the Candlestick, of the Table, and of the golden Altar, and their positions in the Sanctuary are explained in the Gemara Menahoth and Yoma.  "
