It is contained in His words (exalted be He): I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt (Ex 20:2). At the end of Tractate Makkoth it is said: 'Six hundred and thirteen (Taryag) Commandments were declared unto Moses at Sinai, as the verse says, Moses commanded us a law (Torah)'; that is, he commanded us to observe as many Commandments as are signified by the sum of the letter-numbers TORAH. To this it was objected that the letter-numbers of the word TORAH make only six hundred and eleven; to which the reply was: 'The tow Commandments 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.' and 'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me we heard from the Almighty Himself'. Thus it has been made clear to yu that the verse, 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.', is one of the 613 Commandments, and is that whereby we are commanded to believe in God, as we have explained."

This injunction is contained in His words (exalted be He), Hear O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One (Deut 6:4). In most Midrashim you will find this explained as meaning that we are to declare the Unity of God's Name, or the Unity of God, or something of that kind. The intention of the Sages was to teach that God brought us out of Egypt and heaped kindness upon us only on condition that we believe in His Unity, which is our bounded duty. The Commandment to believe in God's Unity is mentioned in many places, and the Sages also call it the Commandment to believe in the Kingdom of HEaven, for they speak of the obligation 'to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven', that is to say, to declare God's Unity and to believe in Him."

    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to love God(exalted be He); that it to say, to dwell upon and contemplate His Commandments, His injunctions, and His works, so that we may obtaine a conception of Him, and in conveiving Him atain absolute joy. This constitutes the Love of God, and it obligatory. As the Sifre says: 'Since it is said, And thou shall love the Lord thy God (Deut 6:5), the question arises, how is one to manifest his love for the Lord? Scripture therefore says: And these words which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart (Deut 6:6); for through this [i.e. the contemplation of God's words] you will learn to discern Him whose word called the Universe in to existance.' We have thus made it clear to you that through this act of contemplation you will attain a conception of God and reach that stage of joy in which loveof Him will follow of necessity. The Sages say that this Commandment also includes an obligation to call upon all mankind to serve Him (exalted be He), and to have faith in Him. For just as you praise and extol anybody whom you love, and call upon others also to love him, so, if you love the Lord to the extent of the conception of His true nature to which you have attained, you will undoubtedly call upon the foolish and ignorant to seek knowledge of the Torah which you have already acquired. As the Sifre says: 'And thou shalt love the Lord they God: this means that you should make Him belovedof man as Abraham your father did, as it said, 'And the souls they had gotten in Haran (Genesis 12).' That is to say, just as Abraham, being a lover of the Lord - as Scripture testifies, AbrahamMy friend(Isa 41:8) - by the power of his conception of God, and out of his great love for Him, summon mankind unto Him.

This injunction is contained in His words, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God.(Deut 6:13). The Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin discusses the verse, he that blasphemeth (nokeb) the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death (Lev 24:16): 'Perhaps the word nokeb should be taken to mean 'pronounceth' [rather than 'blasphemeth'], as we find elsewhere, The men that were pronounced (nikebu) by name (Num 1:17), the [requisite] admonition being derived from the verse, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God? That is to say, the verse, he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, etc., might be understood as meaning one who merely mentions the Name of the Lord, without committing blasphemy; and if you ask  'What son is there in that ?' we reply that such a one abandons the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord not to pronounce His Name in vain. The Sages answer this question, and refute the view involved in it, as follows: 'First, in order to constitute blasphemy the Name must be used [in such a way that it might be represented as both the agent and the object of the blasphemy], and in this instance [of merely pronouncing the Name] the condition is absent'; that is to say, [the accused] must be guilty of blaspheming the Name [ of the Lord] in [His own] Name, just as [the Sages] say [by substitution], 'Let Jose smite Jose'. 'Moreover, the admonition you cite is  in the form of a Positive Commandment, and it is an accepted principle that such an admonition is invalid.' That is to say, your suggestion that a prohibition against the mere pronouncing of the Name of God can be derived from the verse, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, is inadmissible, because that verse is a Positive Commandment, and a prohibition cannot be based upon a Positive Commandment. Thus it has been made clear to you that the words, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, lay down a Positive Commandment."

Although this Commandment is of the class of General Precepts which are excluded from the 613 Commandments under the Fourth Principle, it none the less imposes a specific duty, viz. that of Prayer. The Sifre says: 'to serve Him means Prayer'.The Sages also say: 'to serve Him means study of the Law.' In the Mishnah of R. Eliezer, the son of R.

This injunction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And to Him shall thou cleave(Deut 10:20), which are repeated in the verse, And to cleave unto Him(Deut 11:22). The Sifre says: 'And to cleave unto Him means that we should cleave to wise men and to their disciples'. The Sages also use the words 'to Him thou shall cleave' as proof that it is one's duty to marry a wise man's daughter, to give one's own daughter in marriage to a wise man, to confer benefits on wise men and to have business relationships with them. 'Is it possible', they say, 'for a man to cleave to the Divine Presence, seeing that it is written, For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire(Deut 4:24)?'

This injunction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And by His Name shall thou swear(Deut 6:13, Deut 10:20), in explanation of which the Sages say: 'The Torah says By His name shall thou swear, and again, Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain(Ex 20:7, Deut 10:20). Just as we are forbidden to take an oath for which there is no necesity, and this is a Negative Commandment(Neg. Comm 62), so we are commanded to take an oath when necessary, and this is a Positive Commandment. It is for this reason that it is not permissible to swear by any created object, such as the angels or the stars, save only where the oath is elliptical: as, for instance, where one swears by the truthof the sun, meaning 'by the truth of the God of the sun'. It is in this manner that our nation swears by the name of Moses our Teacher - honoured be his name - as though he who swears were to say 'by the God of Moses', or 'by Hom who sent Moses'. But whenever the one who swears does not mean it so, but swears by a created object, in the belief that that object has in itself such truth that one can swear by it, he transgresses by placing some other object on an equal footing with the Name of Heaven: and on this Tradition says: 'He who places the Name of Heaven on an equal footing with some other object shall be uprooted from the world.' This was the meaning intended by the verse, By His name shalt thou swear: To Him alone shalt thou in faith ascribe the truth by which it is proper to swear. It is said at the beginning of Tractate Temurah: 'Whence do we learn that we my bind ourselves with an oath to perform the Commandments? From the verse, And by His name shalt thou swear.' "

The purpose of this Commandment is that we are duty bound to proclaim this true religion to the world, undeterred by fear of injury from any source. Even if a tyrant tries to compel us by force to deny Him, we must not obey, but must positively rather submit to death; and we must not even mislead the tyrant into supposing that we have denied Him whicle in our hearts we continue to belivein Him(exalted be He). This is the Commandment concerning the Sanctification of the Name which is laid upon every son of Isreal: that we must be ready to die at the tyrant's hands for our love of Him(exalted be He), and for our faith in His unity, even as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah did in the time of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, when he forced people to prostate themselves before the idol, and all did so, the Israelites included, and ther was none there to sanctify the Name of Heaven, all being in terror. This ws a sore disgrace to Israel, in that this Commandment was disregarded by them all, and there was none to fulfill it, all being afraid. This Commandment applies only in circumstance such as those of that great occasion, when the whole world was in terror, and it was a duty to decalre His Unity publicly at that time. The Lord had already promised through Isaiah that Israel would not be completely disgraced on that hard occasion, but young men would appear among them, undeterred by death, and would sacrifuce their lives and proclaim the Faith, sancrtifying the Name publicly, as He commanded us through Moses our Teacher. This promise is in the words, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale; when he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, that they sanctify My name(Isa 29:22-23). The Sifre say: 'On this condition I bought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye sanctify My name publicly(Lev 22:32). The Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin says: 'Is a Noachid commanded to sanctify His Name or not? Listen to this: 'The Noachids were commanded to observe seven Commandments; but if they were [also] commanded to sanctify His Name, there are eight. Thus it has been made clear to you that this is one of the Commandments that are obligatory upon Israel, the Sages having deduced this Commandment from the words, I will be hallowed among the children of Israel.

The proof that the Phylactery of the Head and the Phylactery of the Arm are two [distinct] Commandments we find in the Genara, where the sages express surpise at the opinion that the Phylactery of the Head and the Phylactery of the Arm cannot be worn one without the other, but only when the two are together. 'If', they say , 'one cannot fulfil two Commandments, is he not to fulfil one? That is to say, if one cannot perform two Commandments must he perform neither of them? No: he should fulfil the one which he is able to fulfil. Thus [in the case under discussion] he should wear whichever phylactery he has. Thus it has been made clear to you that the Sages called the Phylactery of the Arm and the Phylactery of the Head two [distinct] Commandments. These two Commandments are not obligatory upon women, for in explanation of their obligatory character He has said, (exalted be He), That the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth(Ex.13.9), and women are not under obligation to study the Torah. This is the explanation given in the Mechilta. All the detailed rules of these two Commandments are set out in the fouth chapter of Menahoth. NOTE Seven rings, symbolizing the seven branches of the Candlestick, asre coild in a descending spiral around the forearm, and three rings, symbolic of Israel's spiritual betrothal to the Lord, are wound around the middle finger, the ensuing ring formations around the back and palm of the hand culminating once again in the Name Shadai. Three Commandments in the Torah are designated by the term oth - 'a sign' - between the Creator and Israel His people: Circumcision, the Sabbath, and the Tefillin or Phylacteries(Gen. 17:11; Ex. 31:13; Ex. 13:9).

The reason is given in the Sifre: One might think that these are two Commandments - the Commandment of the blue and the Commandment of the white; Scripture therefore states, And it shall be unto you for a fringes(Num. 15:39), thus showing that it is one Commandment and not two. This Commandment is not obligatory upon women, as explained at the beginning of Kiddushin. All its provisions are explained in Menahoth.

The conclusion reached at the end of the discussion is: 'One cannot argue from a general rule' [affecting a given class of Commandments as to its applicability to any and every specific Commandment].

This injunction is expressed in His words(exlated be He), Now therefore write ye this song for you(Deut 31:19).' Now since it is not permissible to write[a Scroll of the Law containing only] certain sections of it, it follows of necessity that the words 'this song' mean the whole of the Torah which includes 'this song'. The Gemara of Sanhedrin says: 'Rabah said: Even if one's parents have left him a Scroll of the Law, he is nevertheless commanded to write one of his own, as it is said, Now therefore write ye this song for you. Abaye objected: the King is commanded to write a Scroll of the LAw for himself, for he should not seek credit for one wrtitten by others, and[this surely implies that] it is only a King [who is enjoined to write a Scroll even if his parents have left him one], and not a commoner?

This injuction is contained in His words(exalted be He), And let them make Me a sanctuary(Ex.25:8). The Sifre says: 'The Israelites were obliged to fulfil three Commandments upon their entry into the Land: to appoint a king over themselves, to build the Sanctuary, and to annihilate the offspring of Amalek(Deut. 17:15). Thus it has been made clear to you that the building of the Sanctuary is a distinct Commandment in itself. We have already explained that this general injunction includes particular precepts, and that the Candlestick, the Table, the Altar, and the other [vessels and appurtenances] are all parts of the Sanctuary, and all together are called 'the Sanctuary', although there is a specific regulation for each and every part. It is true that He has said with regard to the Altar, an altar of earth thou shalt make unto Me(Ex.20:21), so that one might suppose this to be an independent, apart from the Commandment to build the Temple; but the true state of the case is as I will explain to you. The literal sense of the verse refers to the time when High Places were permitted to us, and we were allowed to make an Altar of earth in any place, and to offer sacrifices on it: and the Sages already declared that the purpose of the verse was to command us to build an Altar attached to the earth, which would not be movable as it had been in the desert(Num. 4:14; Ex.27:7). This was said by them in the Mechilta of Rabbi Ishmael, where the verse is thus interpreted: 'When you enter the Land you are to make unto Me an altar attached to the ground.' This being so, the Commandment[about the building of the Altar] is one which is binding for all time, relating to one of the parts of the Temple - that is to say, the verse in its entirety(Ex.20:21-22) means that the altar to be built must be of stone. The Mechilta, explaining the words, And if thou make Me an altar of stone(Ex.20:20-22), says: 'Rabbi Ishmael says: Every if in the Torah implies permission, except in three instances, one of which is And if thou make Me an altar of stone.' Thereon the Sages said: 'And if thou make Me an altar of stone establishes an obligation. You maintain this to be an obligation; perhaps it is only permissive? Scripture therefore says, Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of unhewn stones(Deut. 27:6; Ex.20:22). [This proves it to be obligatory, and not merely permissive: so the Commandment relating to the Altar is only a part of the Commandment to build the Temple]. The provisions of this Commandment as a whole, that is to say, thise relating to the building of the Sanctuary, its design and its divisions, the building of the Altar, and the relative laws, are explained in a Tractate specially devoted to the subject, namely Tractate Middoth.

The scope of that reverence is defined in the Sifra: 'What does reverence mean? One may not enter the Temple Mount with his staff, or his sandals, or his wallet, or with the dust upon his feet, nor may he make of it a short cut; still less may he spit there.' It is explained in several places in the Talmud that it was not permissible for anyone to remain seated in the Court[of the Sanctuary] except only the Kings of the House of David. All this follows from His words(exalted be He), And ye shall reverence My sanctuary, the observance of which is binding for all time, even in our own days, when[the Sanctuary], for our manifold sins, has been destroyed.

Because Scripture says, Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary(Lev. 19:30; Lev.26:2): just as the observance of the Sabbath is [binding] for ever, even so reverence for the Sanctuary is [binding] for ever(Lev. 19:30). In the same place we read: 'Your reverence should be not for the Sanctuary, but for Him who commanded us concerning the Sanctuary.' It is for this reason that even today an Israelite is not permitted to walk through those regions of the Temple Mount that he was forbidden to enter when the Temple stood. Moreover, since in view of the laws of cleanness and uncleanness-and of the impossibility of observing these in our days-we must all be adjudged unclean, Jews are altogether forbidden today to enter the Temple grounds.(See also Pos.Comm.31, and Neg.Comm.78.)"

This Commandment is also found in another form: And they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting(Num.18:4). The Sifre says: '[And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee;] and thou and thy sons with thee being before the tent of the testimony: the Priests [are to keep watch] within, and the Levites without'; that is to say, they are to guard and patrol the Sanctuary. The Mechilta says: 'And they shall keep the charge of the tent of meeting: [this verse] gives us only a Posistive Commandment involved? From the verse: Ye shall keep the charge of the holy things.' Thus it has been made clear to you that the guarding of the Sanctuary constitutes a Positive Commandment. In the same place we read: 'It lends glory to the Sanctuary that there are guards over it; for a palace that has guards over it is unlike a palace that has no such guards': and it is known that palterin, 'palace', is a name for the Sanctuary. The meaning is that the Sanctuary is exalted and glorified by having guards appointed to watch over it. All the provisions of this Commandment are explained in Tractates Tamid(first chapter) and Middoth. NOTE Guard was kept at twenty-four places in the Sanctuary at Jerusalem; these were divided among the Priests and the Levites. The Priests watched over three places, and Levites over twenty-one."

It is contained in His words(exalted be He), They shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for splendour and for beauty(Ex. 28:4); and thou shalt bring his sons, and put tunics upon them(Ex. 29:8). These are the Priestly GArments; eight garments for the High Priest, and four for a common Priest. Whenever a Priest performs the service with fewer or with more than the number of garments appointed for that particular service, the service is invalid, and he is also liable to death by the hand of Heaven - I mean one who performs the service with fewer garments than the number appointed. In the Gemara of Sanhedrin likewise such a one is counted among those who are liable to death by the hand of Heaven. This is not explicitly stated in Scripture, but is derived from the verse, Thou shalt gird them with girdles...and they shall have the Priesthood [by a perpetual statute](Ex. 29:9), the interpretation of which is: 'So long as they wear their [appointed] garments, they are invested with their Priesthood; when they do nor wear their garments they are not invested with their Priesthood, and they become laymen. It will be explained below that a layman who ministers [in the Temple] incurs the penalty of death [by the hand of Heaven](See Neg.Comm. 74). The Sifre says: 'He [Moses] placed the breastplate upon him[Aaron](Lev. 8:8): this passage teaches us regulations that apply to the particular occasion, and also regulations that apply permanently; regulations for the service of every day, and also those for the service of the Day of Atonement. Every day [the High Priest] was to minister in the golden raiment, but on the Day of Atonement in the white lined garments. That the putting on of these garments is a Positive Commandment is clear from the following passage in the Sifre: 'Whence do we infer that Aaron did not put on the Priestly garments for his own aggrandisement, but as one who obeys the command of his King? From the words of Scripture: He did as the Lord commanded Moses(Lev. 16:34)' that is to say, although these garments, with their gold, onyx, jasper, and other precious stones, were of peerless beauty, it was not enjoyment of this beauty that the Priest was to consider, but only the fulfilment of the Commandment which the Lord laid upon Moses, namely that he must always wear these garments in the Sanctuary. All the provisions of this Commandment are explained in the second chapter of Zebahim, and in various places in Yoma and Sukkah. NOTE The four garments of the ordinary Priest were the tunic, drawers, turban, and girdle. The High Priest wore in addtion the breastplate, the robe, the upper garment, and the frontlet. A description of all these articles is found in Ex. 28:4-42."

Although this Commandment  was at the time laid upon the Levites, this was only because of the limited number of Priests [then availble], for Aaron was the first [High Priest]. In reality the fulfilment of this Commandment devolves upon the Priests, and it is they who are to bear [the Ark], as is clear from the book of Joshua and the book of Samuel(Josh. 3:14; 2 Sam.15:25). And when David commanded [the Priests and the Levites] to bring up the Ark for the second time, the book of Chronicles records: [So the Priests and the Livites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord, the God of Isreal.] And the children of the Levites bore the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the bars thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord(1 Chron 15:14-15; see also 5:16); [that is to say. the Priests sanctified themselves for the bearing of the Ark, while the Levites did so for the purpose of accompanying the Priests and playing the music]. Likewise, in referring to the division of the Priests into twenty-four Courses, the book of Chronicles says, These were the orderings of them in their service, to come into the house of the Lord according to the ordinance given unto them by the hand of Aaron their father, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him(1 Chron. 24:19). The Sages explain this verse as implying that it is the task of the Priests to perform the service of bearing the Ark upon their shoulders, and that this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded. The Sifre says: 'According to the ordinance unto them...as the lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him: where did He so commande him?

It is shown in Chronicles that David and Samuel divided [the Priests] into twenty-four Courses(1 Chron. 24:4-18), and in [Tractate] Sukkah it is explained that during the Festivals all [the Courses] shared equally [in the service]. The passage of Scripture in which this Commandment is contained is: And if a Levite come [from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth,] and come with all the desire of his soul [unto the place where the Lord shall choose]; then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, s all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before the Lord. They shall have like portions to eat(Deut. 18:6-8). The Sifre says: 'And come with all the desire of his soul: one might [interpret this verse to mean that he might come] at any time [to participate in the Service of the Sanctuary]; Scripture there says, From any of thy gates, that is, when all Israel is assembled in one gate [i.e. in one city - Jerusalem] during the [three] Festivals. One might think that all Courses shared equally in the Fesitval offerings, even in those which were not occasioned by the Festivals themselves [namely, the daily Burnt-offerings brought in the morning and at disk every day of the year]; Scripture therefore says, Beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony(Deut. 18:8 -AV rendering). What is meant by the sale of patrimony? [One Priestly elder says to another,] 'Do thou [minister] in thy week, and I [will minister] in my week'; that is to say, they agreed on the rotation of the Courses, [the Priests gave] their consent to the whole arrangment of the service into Courses, a new Course ministering in turn evry week(The Priests were divided into twenty-four Courses. Each Course came by turn to the Sanctuary for one week's service. The Courses in turn were subdivided into Fathers Houses, each House ministering one day out of the seven. Tamid I,i(Sonc.ed.p.i). So the Targum explains the verse, traslating: 'beside the Course of the week, for thus the fathers ordained it. The provisions of this Commandment are explained at the end of the Gemara of Sukkah. NOTE Nachmanides points out that there is no special Commandment in the Torah ordaining that the Priests are to be divided into Courses. The Torah merely ordains that during the festivals all Priests are to share equally in the offerings. An oral tradition extended to the Sages the option of dividing Israel's Priesthood into Courses, but it was not obligatory upon them as a rule laid down by the Torah to establish such a division.   "

Since Scripture forbids them, out of respect, to defile themselves for the dead, but permits them to defile themselves for relatives, it might be thought to lie within the choice of a Priest whether to defile himself [for a relative] or not. [To exclude this possibility] He imposed a positive obligation on them by saying: For her(that is to say, for his sister) he shall defile himself(Lev. 21:3). The Sifre says: 'For her he shall defile himself, is a Positive Commandment. If he [a Priest] does not wish to defile himself he is made to do so against his will. It happened to Joseph the Priest that his wife had died on the eve of Passover, and he refused to defile himself for her, whereupon the Sages employed force and caused him to become defiled against his own will.' On this Commandment is based the duty of mourning; that is to say, the obligation incumbent upon every man of Israel to mourn for [the loss of] relatives, who are six in number(These are: mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister; a husband and wife are under this obligation by Rabbinic ordinance only(Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Hilchoth Abel II,i). It is to confirm this obligation that He has expressly declared in the case of the Priest, who is [ordinarily] for bidden to suffer defilement, that [in respect of the six relatives] he must defile himself at any rate like all other Israelites, so that the law of mourning may not be lightly esteemed. It has been shown that the mourning of the first day [following the burial of a relative] is prescibed by Scripture law. In the interpretation (of this principle the Sages have) said explicitly in (Tractate) Moed Katan: that mourning is not to be observed during a Festival: 'If the mourning begins before the Festival, the positive precept affecting all Israel [to rejoice on the Festival] overrides that affecting only the individual Commandment enjpining one [to mourn over his deceased relative]. Thus it is clear that the obligation of mourning is Scriptural, but is Scripturally obligatory only on the first day [after burial], while the remaining six days [of mourning are obligatory only by] Rabbinic ordinance; and that even a Priest is bound to observe mourning on the first day, and to defile himself for his[deceased] relatives. Understand this. The detailed rules of this Commandment are set out in Tractate Mashkin[i.e.Moed Katan], in several places in Berachoth, Ketuboth, Yebamoth, and Abodah Zarah, and in the Sifra in the [commentary on] the portion [of Scripture] commencing [with the words] Speak unto the Priests(Lev.21:3]. The obligation of the Priest to defile himself for his [deceiased] relatives does not apply to women [of Priestly families]; for the Priest, who is forbidden to defile himself for non-relatives, is commanded to suffer defilement for relatives, but the woman of Priestly family is not forbidden to defile herself for any deal person, as I will explain in the proper place(Neg.Comm. 166), and is consequently nor commanded or obliged to suffer defilement [foe deceased relatives]. She has to observe mourning, but whether to suffer defilement depends on her own wishes. Understand this.NOTE The rending of garments by relatives at the time of burial, and the observance of Shivah - seven days of strict mourning, during which the relatives of the deceased abstain from work, remain at home, walk unshod, sit on low seats, and receive condolences - are obligations imposed by Rabinnic ordinance. The reciting, at certain points in the service of public worship, of the prayer known as Kaddish(sanctifying the Name of the Lord) by surviving sons for eleven months after the death of a parent(and on every anniversary of the death thereafter) is a custom of post-Talmudic development.

This is the third of the three Commandments that are observed on a festival. The most important obligation entailed by this Commandment is that of the compulsory Peace-offerings. These Peace-offeings are in addition to the Peace-offerings of the Festival [referred to in Commandment 52], and they are called in the Talmud, 'Peace-offerings of the Rejoicing.' With regard to these Peace-offerings we are told: 'Women are under obligation to take part in the rejoicing'; and Scripture says: Thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings, and shalt eat there; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God(Deut. 27:7. This verse shows that the Peace-offering is associated with rejoicing.' The provisions of this Commandment are likewise set out in Tractate Hagigah. The words, thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, include the further injunction of the Sages that we are to rejoice by all possible modes of rejoicing, as by eating on the festivals, drinking wine, putting on new garments, distributing fruits and sweetmeats to children and women, and making merry with musical instruments and dancing in the Sanctuary, though not elsewhere('Making merry with musical instruments and dancing', though forbidden on a festival throughout the Land of Israel, was permitted in the Sanctuary), this being the Rejoicing of Beth Ha-Sho'ebah [the Drawing of the Waters](This was marked by a great public festivity heeld in the Sanctuary during the evenings of the Festival of Tabernacle being associated with the libation of water on the Altar during the festival.). All of these modes of rejoicing are comprised in His wowrds, thou shall rejoice in thy feast. The most binding of these [modes of rejoicing] is the drinking of wine, because that is specially associated with rejoicing. As the Gemara says: 'A man is in duty bound to make his children and his household rejoice on a Festival...Wherewith does he make them rejoice? With wine.' It says, further: 'We have been taught: Rabbi Judah ben Betheira says, When the Sanctuary was in existence, there could be no rejoicing save with meat, as it is said, Thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings...[and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God]. But now, when there is no Sanctuary, there is no rejoicing save with wine, as it is said, Wine that maketh glad the heart of man(Ps. 104:15).' It also says: 'Men [are to rejoice] in a manner appropriate for them, and women in a manner appropriate to them.' The Torah obliges us to include in this rejoicing the poor, the needy, and strangers. His words (exalted be He), are: [Thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou...] and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow(Deut. 16:11). "

The penalty of extinction [for the wilful neglect of this Commandment] is prescribed in His words: But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off [from his people](Num.9:13). In the enumeration of the Commandments - all negative - fro the transgression of which one incurs the penalty of extinction, at the beginning of Tractate Kerithoth, the two Positive Commandments of the Passover and circumcision are included [as involving the same penalty].

    "title": "Eating the Passover-offering",
    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to eat the Passover-offering on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan under the conditions specified: that is to say, it is to be roasted, it is to be eaten on one house(Ex.12:46, See Neg Comm 123), and it is to be eaten with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs. This Commandment is contained in His words (exalted be He), They shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it(Ex.12:8). If any one objects and asks: 'Why do you count the eating of the Passover-offering, the unleavend bread and the bitter herbs as one Commandment, and not as three, seeing that to eat unleavened bread is a Commandment, and to eat bitter herbs is one, and to eat the meat of the Passover-offering is one.' My answer will be: It is true that the eating of unleavened bread is a Commandment in itself, as I shall explain(See Pos.Comm.158); and so is the eating of the meat of the Passover-offering a Commandment in itself, as already mentioned, [this obkigation being explicitly laid down in the words, They shall eat the flesh in that night]. But [the eating of] bitter herbs is incidental to the eating of the Passover-offering, and is not to be counted as an independant Commandment. This is proved by the fact that the meat of the Passover-offering is eaten in fulfillment of the Commandment whether bitter herbs are available or not, but bitter herbs are not eaten except with the meat of the Passover-offering, because He says (exalted be He), They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs(Num. 9:11). By eating bitter herbs without meat one fulfils no obligation whatever, and we cannot say that he fulfils one Commandment, namely, that of eating bitter herbs. In the words of the Mechilta: '[They shall eat the flesh in that night,] roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it: this teaches us that the Commandment regarding the PAssover-offering provides that it is to be eaten roasted, with unleavened bread and bittr herbs(Ex.12:8, Mechilta); that is to say, the [one] Commandment consists of the aggregate of these. It also says there: 'Whence do you infer that in the absence of unleavened bread and of bitter herbs the obligation can be fulfilled by eating only the Passover-offering alone? From the words: they shall eat it'; that is, [they shall eat] the meat alone [if need be]. 'Now one might think that just as in the absence of unleavened bread and bitter herbs the obligation can be fulfilled by eating the Passover-offering, so in the absence of the Passover-offering the obligation can be fulfilled by eating unleavened bread and bitter herbs, the argument being that, since eating the Passover-offering is a Positive Commandment, and eating unleavened bread and bitter herbs is also a Positive Commandment, then, if in the absence of unleavened bread and bitter herbs the obligation can be fulfilled by eating the Passover-offering alone, it should follow that in the absence of the Passover-offering the obligation could be fulfilled by eating unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Scripture therefore says: they shall eat it(Ex.12:8,Mechilta)'; [that is to say, they shall eat the Passover-offering]. It says further: 'They shall eat it: from this we deduce that the Passover-offering is to be eaten to the point of satiety [i.e. after everything else], whereas the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs are to be eaten before [the state of near] satiety has been reached'; since the essence of the Commandment consists in theeating of the meat [of the Passover-offering], as He has said, they shall eat the flesh in that night, whereas [to eat] bitter herbs is an obligation incidental to the eating of the meat, as will be clear from these citations to those who understand them. Clear proof of [the correctness of] our views is to be found in the statement in the Talmud: '[The eating of] bitter herbs nowadays rests only on a Rabbinic ordinance', for so far as the Torah is cincerned there is no obligation to eat them alone, but they are to be eaten with the meat of the Passover-offering. This constitutes clear and evident proof that [the eating of bitter herbs] is one of the things which are incidental to the Commandment [to eat the Passover-offering], and is not a distinct Commandment in itself. The provisions of this Commandment also are explained in Tractate Pesahim. "

This injunction is contained in His words (exalted be He), In the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it(Num. 9:11). Here again it is possible to object and ask: 'Why do you cound [the obligation to offer] the second Passover-offering [as a distinct Commandment], thereby contravening the rule you have laid down in the Seventh Principle, that a regulation pertaining to a Commandment is not itself counted as a [distinct] Commandment? The objector arguing thus should know that the Sages held different views on the question whether the [obligation of the second] Passover-offering is to be regarded as an adjunct of the first, or as a distinct Commandment, and therefore to be counted separately. The Gemara of Pesahim says: 'One incurs extinction on account of the first [Passover-offering], and one incurs extinction on account of the second: this is Rabbi's view. But R.Nathan says: One incurs extinction on account of the first, but not on account of the second: and R.Hananiah ben Akabya says: One does not incur extinction even on account of the first, unless he [deliberately] fails to bring the second.' The Gamara proceeds to ask: 'Wherein do they differ?' and replies: 'Rabbi holds that the second [Passover] is a separate Festival, and R.Nathan holds that it is only complementary to the first.' This explains our assertion [that the Sages differed regarding the status of the second Passover-offering]. The Gemara says in the same place: 'Accordingly, if one wilfully neglects both [Passovers]', that is to say, wilfully fails to bring both the first Passover-offering and the second Passover-offering, 'all agree that he is culpable. If he neglects bith unintentionally, all agree that he is not culpable. If he neglects the first wilfully and the second unintentionally, he is culpable according to Rabbi and R.Nathan, not culpablr according to R.Hananiah ben Akabya. Likewise if his failure is wilful in the case of the first, but he brings the offering on the second, he is culpable according to Rabbi', because in his opinion the second Passover is not merely complementary to the first, and the law in all cases follows Rabbi's view. This Commandment is not binding upon women, for it is explained [in Tractate Pesahim] that for women the second [Passover-offering] is optional.

In such a case he must offer a sacrifice because of the doubt that has arisen, so as to get atonement, and this is called a Suspensive Guilt-offering. If it is subsequently established that the piece he ate was the fat of the kidneys, it is conformed that he has sinned unintentionally, and he must offer a Fixed Sin-offering.(See Pos Comm 69). The verse relative to this offering is in the book of Leviticus: If any one sin, and do any of the things which the Lord hath commanded not to be done, though he know it not, yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to the valuation, for a guilt-offering unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the error which he committed, though he knew it not(Lev. 5:17-18), that is to say, because he did not know whether he had erred or not. This is what the Sages call [a Sin] Unwittingly Committed. The provisions of this Commandment are explained in Tractate Kerithoth. "

This is called an Unconditional Guilt-offering. The transgressions for which this offering is required are: sacrilege, robbery, having connection with a betrothed bondwoman, and swearing falsely in a case of a deposit. Whoever commits sacrilege unintentionally, that is to say, whoever derives a perutah's(i.e.the smallest copper coin current in the days of the Sages) worth of advantage from anything belonging to the Sanctuary, whether of the Consecreted Things that pertain to the Temple treasury, or of those that pertain to the Altar; or whoever robs his fellow of the value of a perutah or more, and swears [falsely in the matter]; or whoever has connection with a betrothed bondwoman, whether unintentionally or wilfully - in all these cases he is under obligation to bring an offering for his sin - not a Sin-offering, but a Guilt-offering, and such an offering is called an Unconditional Guilt-offering. As regard sacrilege His words (exlated be He) are: [if any one commit a trespass], and sin through error, in the holy things of the Lord, then he shall bring his forfeit, etc(Lev 5:15). [As regards robbery and swearing falsely in a case of a deposit] His words are: [If any one sin...] and deal falsely with his neighbour in a matter of a deposit,...and swear to a lie,...he shall bring his forfeit unto the Lord, a ram without blemish, etc.(Lev. 5:21-22,25) [As regards having connection with a betrothed bondwoman] His words are, And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man...he shall bring his forfeit,etc(Lev. 19:20-21).

The transgressions for which this sacrifice is required are: the defilement of the Sanctuary or its Hallowed Things, an Oath of Utterance(i.e. an oath binding one to perform or to refrain from an action which the Torah does not forbid, e.g.'I swear that I will eat this loaf',etc.), and a [false] Oath concerning Testimony. If one who has been made unclean by any of the primiary source of uncleanness (as we have explained in the introduction to the Order of Tohoroth) unintentionally enters the Sanctuary, which would involve defilement of the Sanctuary; if one unintentionally eats meat that is holy, which would involve defilement of its Hallowed Things; if one swears an Oath of Utterance and unintentionally fails to keep it; if one swears a false oath concerning testimony, either unintentionally or wilfully - in each of these cases he must offer what is called a Sacrifice of Higher or Lower Value. This Commandment is contained in His words(exalted be He), If any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, [he being a witness...if he do not utter it, then he shall near his iniquity;] of if any one touch any unclean thing...it being hidden from him that he is unclean...and when he knoweth of it, be guilty; or if any one swear clearly with his lips(i.e.not merely in his heart),...and it be hid from him...and it shall be, when he shall be guilty [in one of these things...] and he shall bring his forfeit...and if his means suffice not[for a lamb,etc.](Lev. 5:1-11). This sacrifice is called a Sacrifice of Higher or Lower Value because it has not to be of one specified kind, but may vary in accordance with the means of the transgressor who has to offer it. The provisions of this Commandment also are explained in Tractates Kerithoth and Shevuoth."

    "title": "Making confession",
    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to make oral confession of the sins we have committed against the Lord(exalted be He) after we have repented of them. This is the form of confession: 'O God, I have sinned, I have committed iniquity, I have transgressed, and I have done thus and thus.' One must elaborate and ask forgiveness with all the eloquence at his command. You must know that even in the case of transgressions for which one is under obligation to offer one of the offerings specified above, for which the Lord has promised forgiveness to him who offers them, the offering alone without confession is not sufficient. This follows from His words(exlated be He), Speak unto the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit...then they shall confess their sin which they have done(Num 5:6-7). Commenting on this verse, the Mechilta says: 'Sonceit says: he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned(Lev. 5:5), we infer that he must confess upon the sin which he has committed, that is, upon the sin-offering whilst it is still alive, not after it has been slaughtered. The verse does not tell us that the individual is to make confession for any [sin] except that of entering the Sanctuary [in a state of uncleanness].' For this verse, He shall confess that wherein he hath sinned, occurs in the Scriptural portion 'Va'yikra'(Lev. 1:1-5:26) with reference to the defiling of the Sanctuary and its Hallowed Things, and to [transgressions] which are mentioned together with these [i.e. and Oath of Testimony and an Oath of Utterance], as we have explained. This is why the Mecilta says that we can derive the obligation of making confession from that verse only in the case of one who has defiled the Sanctuary. 'Whence do you derive its application in the case of violation of any of the other Commandments? From the words of Scripture: Speak unto the children of Israel: [When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the Lord, and that soul be guilty;] then they shall confess[their sin which they have done.] Whence do you further [extend the obligation so as to make it apply to those Commandments whose transgression entails the penalty of] extinction or death [by the hand of Heaven]? From the words Their sin, that is, all their sins, extending the application [of confession] to Negative Commandments. Which they have done, extends the application to [violations of] the Positive Commandments(Found in Num.5:6-7, Sifra Zuta). The Michilta says in the same place: 'Any sin that men commit; this means violation of Commandments which involve relations with one's fellow men, [such as] theft, robbery, and speaking evil. To commit a trespass [against the Lord]: this includes false swearing and blaspheming. [And that soul] be guilty: this extends the obligation of making confession to all who incur the death-panalty [by judicial sentence].One might think that even those who are about to be put to death through false witnesses [must confess to the crimes of which they are falsely accused]; Scripture therefore says that soul be guilty: that is to say, the obligation of making confession is not compulsory upon one who knows that he has committed no transgression and that false testimony has been given against him.' Thus it has been explained to you that all kinds of sins, great or small, and even [the violation of] Positive Commandments, carry with them the obligation of making confession. Now since the Commandment, then they shall confess, is mentioned only in connection with the obligation of offering a sacrifice, the idea might occur to us that confession is not itself a separate obligation, but is only something incidental to the sacrifice. Hence [the Sages] were obliged to explain this in the Mechilta as follows: 'One might think that confession is necessary [only] when an offering is made: whence do we learn that it is necessary also when there is no offering? From the words of Scripture: Speak unto the children of Israel...then they shall confess. Still one may think that the obligation of making confession is binding only in the Land[of Israel]; whence do you infer[that it is binding] in the Diaspora also? From Scripture: And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers(Lev. 26:40. the verse refers to a time when Israel would be dispersed). Thus did Daniel[who lived outside the Land of Israel] say, Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness(Dan 9:7). Thus it has been made clear to you from all we have said that confession is itself a separate obligation, and is binding upon the transgressor for every sin that he commits, whether it be in the Land or outside it, whether he has made an offering or not. In any case he is bound to make confession, inaccordance with His words(exalted be He), then they shall confess their sin. The Sifre also says: 'And [Aaron shall] confess:(Lev. 16:21): this means oral confession.' The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the last chapter of [Tractate] Kippurim [i.e.Yoma]. NOTE repentance, however, must be sincere and wholehearted: 'If a man says, 'I will sin and repent, and sin again and repent', he will be given no chance to repent'(Yoma 85b)."

This is the offering of the zavah, whose atonement is not complete until she brings it. Now one may perhaps object and say: 'Since the offering of a zav is the same as the offering of a zavah, and you [in enumerating the 613 Commandments] take into account only the type of offering involved, and pay no regard to the type of transgressor - this being your practice in the case of the Sin-offering, the Unconditional Guilt-offering, the Suspensive Guilt-offering and the Sacrifice of Higher or Lower Value, where you count each one as a separate Commandment, without troubling about the variety of transgressions for any of which the sacrifice in question may be required - why do you not adopt the same practice here, and disregard the fact that there are different individuals from whom the same offering of a bird may be required [thus counting the Commandments laid on the zav and the zavah as one Commandment only?] One who argues thus must be informed that the offering of the man or the woman suffering a flux is not brought because of sin, but is obligatory in certain circumstances. If the nature of the flux were the same in men and in women, as it is in name, the one being called a zav, and the other a zavah, then it would be appropriate to count the two Commandments as one. But that is not in fact the case; for it is the emission of semen that makes a man liable for an offering, but if a woman has a sort of emmision of semen, she is not a zavah, and it is only a flux of blood that makes a woman liable for an offering, whereas a flux of blood does not make a man liable. The word 'flux' means only 'flowing out', and what flows out is not always the same thing. The Sages say explicitly: 'A man conveys uncleanness through semen, a woman through blood.'(Lev 15:3, Sifre) The law of a zav and a zavah is not analogous to the law of a male and a female leper. This is clearly proved by what is said in Kerithoth: 'There are four persons whose atonement remains incomplete [until after the offering prescribed in each instance has been brought; namely], a man and a woman with a flux, a woman after childbirth, and a leper.' You see that the zav and the zavah are counted as two, because the flux of a man is different from that of a woman, whereas the male and the female leper are not distinguished. The verse relating to the offering of a zavah is: But if she be cleansed of her issue...on the eight day she shall take unto her tow turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, etc(Lev 15:28-29)."

It is explained there that this Commandment is also binding outside of the Land [of Israel] and after the destruction of the Sanctuary. This is the law laid down in the Torah. But lest it should be eaten [outside Jerusalem] although unblemished - since we have no Sanctuary - the Rabbis ordained that this Commandment should be binding only while the Temple stood, and that on the rebuilding of the Temple it should be binding both in and outside the Land. NOTE The Priest received no part of the tuthe of cattle. The fat and blood of the animal once offered upon the Altar, it belonged wholly to its owner, as in the case of the Passover-offering. If the animal developed a defect - whether before or after its being set aside as tithe - it could be sluaghtered and eaten anywhere. The duty to set aside this tithe rested equally upon the Priest, the Levite, and the Israelite."
