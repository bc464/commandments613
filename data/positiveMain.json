It is contained in His words (exalted be He): I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt (Ex 20:2). At the end of Tractate Makkoth it is said: 'Six hundred and thirteen (Taryag) Commandments were declared unto Moses at Sinai, as the verse says, Moses commanded us a law (Torah)'; that is, he commanded us to observe as many Commandments as are signified by the sum of the letter-numbers TORAH. To this it was objected that the letter-numbers of the word TORAH make only six hundred and eleven; to which the reply was: 'The tow Commandments 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.' and 'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me we heard from the Almighty Himself'. Thus it has been made clear to yu that the verse, 'I am the Lord thy God, etc.', is one of the 613 Commandments, and is that whereby we are commanded to believe in God, as we have explained."

This injunction is contained in His words (exalted be He), Hear O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One (Deut 6:4). In most Midrashim you will find this explained as meaning that we are to declare the Unity of God's Name, or the Unity of God, or something of that kind. The intention of the Sages was to teach that God brought us out of Egypt and heaped kindness upon us only on condition that we believe in His Unity, which is our bounded duty. The Commandment to believe in God's Unity is mentioned in many places, and the Sages also call it the Commandment to believe in the Kingdom of HEaven, for they speak of the obligation 'to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven', that is to say, to declare God's Unity and to believe in Him."

    "title": "Love of God",
    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to love God(exalted be He); that it to say, to dwell upon and contemplate His Commandments, His injunctions, and His works, so that we may obtaine a conception of Him, and in conveiving Him atain absolute joy. This constitutes the Love of God, and it obligatory. As the Sifre says: 'Since it is said, And thou shall love the Lord thy God (Deut 6:5), the question arises, how is one to manifest his love for the Lord? Scripture therefore says: And these words which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart (Deut 6:6); for through this [i.e. the contemplation of God's words] you will learn to discern Him whose word called the Universe in to existance.' We have thus made it clear to you that through this act of contemplation you will attain a conception of God and reach that stage of joy in which loveof Him will follow of necessity. The Sages say that this Commandment also includes an obligation to call upon all mankind to serve Him (exalted be He), and to have faith in Him. For just as you praise and extol anybody whom you love, and call upon others also to love him, so, if you love the Lord to the extent of the conception of His true nature to which you have attained, you will undoubtedly call upon the foolish and ignorant to seek knowledge of the Torah which you have already acquired. As the Sifre says: 'And thou shalt love the Lord they God: this means that you should make Him belovedof man as Abraham your father did, as it said, 'And the souls they had gotten in Haran (Genesis 12).' That is to say, just as Abraham, being a lover of the Lord - as Scripture testifies, AbrahamMy friend(Isa 41:8) - by the power of his conception of God, and out of his great love for Him, summon mankind unto Him.

    "title": "Fear of God",
    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to believe in the fear and awe of God(exalted be He), and not to be ease and self-confident but to expect His punishment at all times. This injunction is contained in His words, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God.(Deut 6:13). The Gemara of Tractate Sanhedrin discusses the verse, he that blasphemeth (nokeb) the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death (Lev 24:16): 'Perhaps the word nokeb should be taken to mean 'pronounceth' [rather than 'blasphemeth'], as we find elsewhere, The men that were pronounced (nikebu) by name (Num 1:17), the [requisite] admonition being derived from the verse, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God? That is to say, the verse, he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, etc., might be understood as meaning one who merely mentions the Name of the Lord, without committing blasphemy; and if you ask  'What son is there in that ?' we reply that such a one abandons the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord, for it is part of the fear of the Lord not to pronounce His Name in vain. The Sages answer this question, and refute the view involved in it, as follows: 'First, in order to constitute blasphemy the Name must be used [in such a way that it might be represented as both the agent and the object of the blasphemy], and in this instance [of merely pronouncing the Name] the condition is absent'; that is to say, [the accused] must be guilty of blaspheming the Name [ of the Lord] in [His own] Name, just as [the Sages] say [by substitution], 'Let Jose smite Jose'. 'Moreover, the admonition you cite is  in the form of a Positive Commandment, and it is an accepted principle that such an admonition is invalid.' That is to say, your suggestion that a prohibition against the mere pronouncing of the Name of God can be derived from the verse, Thou shall fear the Lord thy God, is inadmissible, because that verse is a Positive Commandment, and a prohibition cannot be based upon a Positive Commandment. Thus it has been made clear to you that the words, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, lay down a Positive Commandment."

    "text": "By this injunction we are commanded to serve God(exalted be He). This Commandment is repeated several times in Scripture, e.g. And ye shall serve the Lord your God(Ex 23:25); and Him shall ye serve(Deut 13:5); and Him shalt thou serve(Deut 6:13); and to serve Him(Deut 11:13). Although this Commandment is of the class of General Precepts which are excluded from the 613 Commandments under the Fourth Principle, it none the less imposes a specific duty, viz. that of Prayer. The Sifre says: 'to serve Him means Prayer'.The Sages also say: 'to serve Him means study of the Law.' In the Mishnah of R. Eliezer, the son of R. Jose Ha-Galili, the Sages say: 'Whence do we learn that Prayer is obligatory? From the verse, Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; and Him shalt thou serve(Deut 6:13).' The Sages also say: 'Serve Him through His Torah, and serve Him in His Sanctuary', which means that we should aspire to pray either in the Temple or towards it, as Solomon clearly said(1 Kings 8:30)"
