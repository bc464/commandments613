The purpose of this is to deter us from making images altogether, so that we should not think, as the masses do, that they possess supernatural powers. This prohibition is contained in His words (exalted be He), Ye shall not make with Me - god of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.(Exodus 20:20). In explanation of this prohibition the Mechilta says: 'Gods of silver...ye shall not make: lest you should say: I am going to make them merely for ornaments, as others do in various countries, Scripture says, 'Ye shall not make unto you'. Transgression of this Negative Commandment is punishable by whipping. The provisions of this Commandment - what figures we are permitted and forbidden to fashion, and in what maneer, and so forth - are explained in the third chapter of Abodah Zarah. It is explained in Sanhedrin that this Negative Commandment - that is,  His words, Ye shall not make with Me - gods of silver, etc. - also embraces other matters which go beyond the scope of these Commandments; but the literal sense of the verse is what we have set out, as explained in the Mechilta.

    "title": "Bowing down to an idol",
    "text": "By this probition we are forbidden to bow down to an idol; and it is clear that the trm 'idol' means any object of worship other than the Lord. This prohibition is contained in His words (exalted be He), Thou shall not bow down unto them, nor serve them(Exodus 20:5). The intention is not to prohibit only the act of bowing down, to the exclusion of other [forms of worship]; only one of the modes of worship, namely, bowing down, is mentioned, but we are equally forbidden to sacrifice, [or pour a libation], or burn incense before an idol; and whoever does one of these forbidden things, i.e. who bows down, or sacrifices, or pours a libation, or burns incense [before an idol], is liable to stoning. The Mechilta says: 'He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed.'(Exodus 22:19) We have thus heard the penalty, but we have not heard the admonition. Scripture therefore says, Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them. Sacrificing, which is included [among the forbidden acts], is here singled out for special mention to teach us the following lesson: In the case of sacrifice, which is something that is performed in the worship of God, it is a sin [to perform it for an idol] whether [the  idol] is ordinarily worshipped in that manner or not; so also in the case of any other act which is performed in the service of God, it is a sin [to perform it for an idol], whether [the idol] is ordinarily worshipped in that manner or not. The meaning of this dictum is that whoever performs before an idol any one of these four acts of worship - namely, bowing down, sacrificing, burning incense, and pouring a libation - which we are under obligation to perform in the service of God, is liable to stoning, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner. This is what is meant by the expression 'not ordinarily worshipped': although one has not worshipped the idol in the manner in which it is customary to worship it, yet worshipping it in one of the ways mentioned renders him liable to stoning if he has sinned wilfully, and to the extinction if his sin was not witnessed or he has not been punished for it. If, however, the sin is committed unintentionally, the sinner must offer a fixed Sin-offering. This applies also to one who deifies any object whatever. (As e.g. one who picks up a brick and says, 'Thou are my god'). This prohibition - that is, the prohibition against doing homage to an idol by any one of these four modes of worship, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner - is repeated in His words (exalted be He), And they shall no more sacrifice their sactifices unto the satyrs(se-irim)(Leveticus 17:7), on which the Sifra says: 'Se-irem means demons. In the Gemara of Zebahim it is explained that this prohibition applies particularly to the case of one who slaughters a sacrifice to an idol, even if it is not ordinarily worshipped in that way: 'How do we know that if one sacrifices an animal to Merkulis(i.e. Mercury, the Roman divinity, who was customarily worshipped by throwing stones to his statue) he is liable to punishment? Because it is written, They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs. Since [this verse] is redundant in regard to the ordinarily manner of worship, [which is forbidden] by the verse [Take heed (See text of Neg. Comm. 193) to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them...saying,] 'How used these nations to serve their gods?[even so will I do likewise]'(Deut. 12:30), take it as referring to an abnormal manner of worship. Hence wilful contravention of this prohibition is punishable by both extinction and stoning, as explained above, and whoever transgresses it unintentionally must bring an offering. The relevant words of Scripture are: He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed. The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin. "

This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), Nor serve them (Ex 20:5), on which the Mechilta says: Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them: they are two separate and independent sins - offering a sacrifice and bowing down. Accordingly, one who throws a stone to [Baal] Peor or excretes to Merekulis is not guilty of sin, since these are not customary modes of worship to be included under His words(exalted be He), [Take heed to thyself...that thou enquire not after their gods, saying:] How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.(Deit. 12:30). Wilful contravention of this prohibition is punishable bt stoning and extinction, and one who violets it unontentionally must bring an offering. The provisions of this Commandment also are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin, where we read: Why is extinction thrice [mentioned as the punishment for] idolatry(Lev.20:3,5; Num. 15:31). It is prescibed once for [worshipping an idol in] the customary manner; once for [worshipping it in] a non-customary manner; and once for [for worship of] Molech. That is to say, one who worships any idol in any way whatever is liable to extinction, provided that the manner of worship is the cutomary one, such as excreting to [Baal] Peor, or throwing a stone to Merkulis, or removing one's hair before Chemosh(Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites - 1 Kings 11:7). Similarly, one who worships any idol whatever in any one of the four specified ways is liable to extinction, even if the manner of worship is not the cutomary one, as if one sacrifices to [Baal] Peor, or bows down to Merkulis -  which would be a 'non-customary' manner of worship. The third[Scriptural mention of] extinction applies to one who causes his offspring to pass through the fire in the worship of Molech, as I shall explain[in connection with the next Commandment]. "

The prohibition of such conduct is repeated in His words There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire(Deut 18:10).

The prohibition of this practice is in the words, Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits(yidde'oni)(Lev. 19:31). This is not to be regarded as lav she-bik'laluth[in which case the prohibitions of the practices of the ob and of the yidde'oni would count only as one Negative Commandment.

    "title": "Studying idolatrous practices",
    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to take an interest in idolatry or study its practices: that is, to learn by enquiry the follies and superstitions taight by its founders, as for instance that a certain spirit can be brought down by such-and-such means, and will behave in such-and-such a way; or that if incense is burnt to a certain star, and the worshippers stand before it in such-and-such a position, it will act in a certain manner; and the like. Merely thinking about these matters, and enquiring into these illusions, leads fools to frequent idols and worship them. The Scriptural verse containing the prohibition of these practices is: Turn ye not unto the idols(Lev. 19:4), on which the Sifra says: 'If you turn after them you make them gods'. The Sifra also quotes R.Judah as saying: '[Turn ye not unto the idols] - turn ye not to see them.': that is to say, do not even look at the physical idol, or study its craftmanship, so as not to spen a moment on anything connected with it. In [Tractate Shabbath], chapter Sheol Adam, the Sages say: 'The writing under the painting or an image may not be read on the Sabbath. And as for the image itself, one must not look at it even on weekdays(This applies only to pictures used in idol-worship), because it is said, Turn ye not unto the idols. How is this to be understood? Said R.Johanan: Turn ye not unto that which is conceived in your own minds.' This prohibition of thinking about idols is repeated in His words, Take head to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside and serve [other gods](Deut 11:16). That is to say, if your mind falls into the error of thinking about idols, this will lead you to stray from the right path, and actually worship them. He further says on this same matter, Lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, etc(Deut. 4:19). For He does not forbid the mere raising the head and observing the heavenly bodies with the eyes; what he forbids is looking with eye of the mind at what their worshippers attribute to them. So also His words: [Take heed to thyself...] that thou enquire not after their gods, saying: 'How used these nations to serve theor gods? even so will I do likewise(Deut. 12:30), are an admonition to us not to enquire after the manner of their worship, even though we do not worship them ourselves, because all this leads to going astray after them. You must know that whoever transgresses this prohibition is liable to whipping?(This applies only where an overt act is involved, as where the idol is covered and the person concerned removes its veil in order to look at it). This is made clear at the end of the first chapter of Erubin, in connection with the ruling that the penalty of whipping for breach of the laws of erub of Boundaries(Neg.Comm 321) is prescribed by Scriptural law. In support of this the Scriptural words, Let no(al) man go out of his place[on the seventh day] were cited(Ex16:29); and when an objector asked, 'Is whipping the punishment for breach of a prohibition expressed by al and not by lo?' he was met with the reply: 'If whipping were not the punishment for breach of a prohibition expressed by al, it would follow that the breach of the prohibition Turn ye not(al) unto the idols, would not be punishable by whipping[but in fact it is]. This shows that contravention of this prohibition is punishable by whipping."

This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), And make no mention of the name of other gods(Ex.23:13) (meaning), 'You may not cause the idolater to swear by his deity'. The Mechilta also say in the same place, 'And make no mention [of the name of other gods] - this means that one may not make a vow in the name of an idol'. In Sanhedrin it is said: 'And make no mention(of the name of other gods) - this means that one may not say to his friend, Wait for me at the place of such-and-such and idol.' Whoever transgresses this prohibition - that is, swear by any created object which misguided people have come to regard as a deity, as though it were a superior being - is liable to whipping. The Gemara of Sanhedrin says, in connection with the Rabbinical prohibition of kissing or embracing an idol, or sweeping the floor before it, and similar actions indicating respect and love for it: 'For none of these actions is the offender whipped(The reason being that they are all included in one general prohibition (Turn ye not unto the idols-Lev.19:4), for which no punishment is prescibed), except for vowing or swearing by the name of an idol.' The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin.

Scripture does not contain a precise and specific prohibition on this matter, that is, a prohibition of prophesying in the name of an idol; but Scripture prescribed the punishment, namely death, for this offence in His words(exalted be He), [The prophet...] that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die(Deut. 18:20). This death is by strangulation, because we have a general tule that where Scripture prescibes the death penalty without more precise definition, strangulation is intended. You are already acquainted with the rule which I have explained to you in connection with the fourteenth of the Principles set out in the Introduction to this work - the rule laid down by the Sages in the words: 'Scripture never prescribes a punishment without first stating a prohibition.' Now [in the case under consideration] the prohibition is to be derived from the words: Make no mention of the name of other gods(Ex. 23:13; See Neg.Comm.14); for it is not impossible that a single Negative Commandment should serve as the admonitory warning for a number of prohibitions, and yet should not constitute a lav she-bik'laluth(See Neg.Comm 9. The verse Make no mention, etc, is made to serve as the admonitory basis of both Neg.Comm 14 and the Commandment now under consideration), since a separate punishment is laid down in each case. I will give you illustrations of this principle in due course. The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin."

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to prohecy falsely: that is, to utter in the name of the Lord a prophecy which the Lord(exalted be He) has not spoken, or has spoken to someone other than him who arrogates it to himself and says falsely that the Lord has spoken it to him. This Negative Commandment is contained in His words, But the prophet shall speak a word presumptuously in My name,  which I have not commanded him to speak, [or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die](Deut. 18:20). In this case also the punishment for contravention of the prohition is strangulation: the Talmud includes 'a false prophet' in the list of transgressors who are to be strangled. It also says in the same place: 'Three are liable to death by the hand of man: [the prophet] that shall speak presumptuously in My name means one who prophesies what he has not heard(i.e. the prophecy itself is altogether fictitious); which I have not commanded, meansone who prophesies what was not spoken to him; or that shall speak in the name of other gods means one who prophesies in the name of an idol. Concerning all of them it is written, that same prophet shall die; and wherever the death penalty is decreed in Scripture without specification [of the method], strangulation is intended. The provisions of the law regarding a false prophet are explained in the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin. NOTE As interpreted in Jewish tradition, the meaning of these verses is as follows: 'As to calamities predicted by a prophet - as when, for example, he foretells the death of a certain individual or states that in a certain year there will be famine or war, and so forth -  the non-fulfillment of his forecast does not disprove his prophetic standing...For God is long-suffering and abounding in kindness, and repents of the evil[He has threatened]. It may also be that [those who were admonished] repented and were forgiven, as happened to the people of Nineveh. Possibly, too, the execution of the sentence is only deferred, as in the case of Hezekiah. But if the prophet[in the name of the Lord] foretells good fortune, declaring that a definite event will come to pass to pass, and the benefit promised is not realized, he is unquestionably a false prphet. For no blessing, decreed by the Almighty, even if promised conditionally, is ever revoked."

The punishment of any of these offences is whipping. The prohibition on this matter is repeated in another form, in His words, Take heed to thyself lest thou be ensnared to follow them(Deut. 12:30) on which the Sifre says: 'Take heed is a Negative Commandment; lest is a Negative Commandment; be ensnared to follow them - lest thou liken thyself to them, and follow theor customs, and they become a snare unto thee. You are not to say: Since [the idolaters] go out dressed in purple, I will go out dressed in purple; since they are dressed in telusin - a kind of ornament worn by soldiers - even so will I go out dressed in telusin.'

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to practise divination, that is, to use any of the various means of stimulating the faculty of conjecture. For all those who have the power of foretelling the future accomplish what they do because the faculty of conjecture is highly developed in them, and as a rule it works correctly; consequently they have a presentiment of what will take place, and some of them are superior to others, just as amongst all men some excel others in this or that faculty of the soul. Now it is necessary for those who have these powers of conjecture to stimulate them and rouse them to activity by one means or another. One of them will knock in the ground several times with his staff, utter strange cries, and concentrate his thoughts for a long time, until he falls into a kind of trance and commences predicting the future. I once saw this done in the extreme West(i.e.Spain(Vs add: 'Another will smooth the sand and draw pictures on it - a practice very common in the West). Another will throw pebbles into a piece of skin, look at them for a long time, and then prophesy - a common practice in all the places I have visited(Maimonides left his native Spain at the age of thirteen, and together with his father and family travelled through Northern Africa and Palestine. He finally settled in Cairo).  Yet another will throw a long leather belt on the ground, observe [the shape in which it falls], and prophecy. The object of all this is to stimulate the powers he possesses; his ritual does not produce any effect or give him any information. This is where the masses of men are in error. When some of the predictions come true, they think that these practices really reveal the future; and they persist in this error, until they come to believe that some of these practices are the cause of the events which follow, just as astrologers are wont to think. The art of astrology is, indeed, akin to this [practice of divination], in that both are means of stimulating the faculty [of conjecture]. Hence no two men are alike in respect of the truth of their prophecies, though many may be equal as regards their knowledge of the art [of astrology]. One who engages in any of these practices, or other customary practices of the same kind, is called a kosem, diviner; and the Lord(exalted be He), says: There shall not be found among you...one that useth divination(kosem kesamim)(Deut. 18:10). On this the Sifre says: 'What is a kosem? One who takes his stick in his hand and says [as though he were consulting it]: 'Shall I go, or shall I not go?''. It is concerning this type of divination, popular in those days, that the prophet said: My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them(Hosea 4:12). Whoever transgresses in this way - that is, practises divination, and does things which enable him to predict the future - is liable to whipping. This does not apply to one who consults a diviner, though the act of consulting him is blameworthy in the extreme(According to Nachmanides, one who consults a diviner violates the Positive Commandment, Thou shalt be whole-hearted with the Lord thy God(Deut 18:13); (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah, 179:1). The provisions of this Commandment are explained in may places in the Gemara of Sanhedrin, in the Tosefta of Shabbath, and in the Sifre. NOTE According to the 'Sefer ha-Chinuch'(a classical Hebrew work of the thirteenth century on the mitzvoth) The Lord is the Supreme Ruler of the universe and of all powers therein, and even if the portents of the future inidcate a certain event, He may in His wisdom change it. The miracles He has caused for our ancestors, as related in Scripture, and all other righteous people through the generations, sufficiently prove that we are not 'the slaves of the stars'(COmm. 510).

This prohibition covers also deceit by optical illusion. The Sages say: 'Me'onen: this refers to one who deceives by optical illusion(Deut. 18:10, Sifre. This explanation is based upon the similarity of the words me'onen and 'ayin, meaning eye.): this covers a large number of tricks accomplished by sleight of hand, which deceive men into thinking that they see things which do not exist. Thus they have their regular tricks, as when one takes a rope and before the eyes of the onlookers puts it away in the corner of his garment, whence he then brings out a snake; or he may throw a ring into the air, and then produce it out of the mouth of one of the persons standing before him; and there are other similar magic tricks, which are popular with the masses. All tricks of this kind are forbidden, and whoever performs them is called a deceiver(Heb. ochez et ha-'ainayim.); and, because his tricks are a kind of witchcraft, is punishable by whipping. He is also a deceiver of people, and causes very great harm by making that which could not possibly exist appear possible to fools, women and children, and thus accustoming them to accept impossibilities as possible.

The object of this prohibition also is that we should not imitate the idolaters, because it was their custom to shave off only their temples. Accordingly, the Sages deemed it necessary to explain in Tractate Yebamoth that 'Shaving the entire head is regarded as 'rounding', so that you should not argue that the object of this prohibition is to prevent us from shaving the temples while leaving the rest of the hair(on the head) unshaven, like the idolatrous priests, but shaving the entire head is not imitation of them [and therefore the prohibition does not apply to it]. Hence the Sages tell us that in no circumstances is it permissible to shave the temples, whether alone or together with the entire head; and [the shaving of] each temple is punishable by whipping, so that one who shaves his entire head is to be whipped twice.

Scripture does not say 'Neither shalt thou mar thy beard', but Neither shalt thou mar the corners of the whole beard, which according to Tradition consists of the five 'corners', as detailed above, and one is liable to five whippings for shaving his entire beard, even though he shaves it off all at once. The Mishnah says: '[For shaving off] the beard [one is liable on] five counts: two counts for the right side, two for the left, and one for lower down. R.Eliezer says: If he took them all off in a single movement, he is liable only on one count'; and from this the Talmud concludes: 'Hence (we must conclude) that R.Eliezer considers the whole [process as covered by the] one prohibition.' Thus we have clear proof that the First Sage [i.e. the first of the authorities quoted in the Mishnah] is of the opinion that there are five prohibitions, and that is the law. [The marring of the beard] was likewise a practice of idolatrous priests, and it is well known that in our day European priests shave off their beards.

The Gemara of Yebamoth explains that 'Lo tithgodedu is required for its own context, the All-Merciful having said, 'You shall not inflict upon yoursleves any bruises for the dead.'' The Gemara of Makkoth says: 'Seritah (cutting with the hand) and gedidah (cutting with an instrument) are the same [i.e. are covered by the same Commandment].' It is also explained there that [one who cuts himself] for the dead, whether with the hand or with an instrument, is liable to whipping; [one who does so] in the practice of idolatry is liable if he does it with an instrument, but exempt if with the hand(since this is not the regular manner of doing it(cf. Neh.Comm.6)), as we find in the books of the prophets: They cut themselves (va-yithgodedu) after their manner with swords and lances(1 Kings 18:28). The Talmud says that this Negative Commandment also forbids dividing the people and causing faction and strife, understanding lo tithgodedu as, 'Ye shall not form yourself into factions(agudoth).' The real meaning of the verse, however, is, as the Sages explain, 'Ye shall not inflict upon yourselves any bruise for the dead'; this [other interpretation] is merely a derash[i.e. a non-halachic exposition of Scripture]. Similarly, their saying that 'he who is unyielding in a dispute violates a Negative Commandment, as it is said, That he be not as Korah and as his company(Num. 17:5), is also a derash, the real purpose of the verse being to defer [future malcontents from questioning the right of the descendants of Aaron to the priesthood]. And as the Sages explain the verse, it contains a negative statement and not a prohibition; their interpretation being that the Lord declares that whoever in future disputes the authority of the priests and claims the priesthood for himself will not be visited with the punishment meted out to Korah -  that is, will not be swallowed up by the earth - but will be punished as the Lord said concerning him by the hand of Moses(Num 17:5): that is to say, with Leprosy, as when He said to Moses: Put now thy hand into thy bosom, [and he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous](Ex. 4:6), and as it related of king Ussaih(1 Chron. 26:16-21). To return to the subject of this Commandment, its provisions are explained at the end of Makkoth; and the punishment for contravention of this prohibition is whipping.

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden ever to settle in the land of Egypt, in order that we should not learn the heresy of the Egyptians or follow their customs, which are repugnant to the Torah. This prohibition is contained in His words (exalted be He), Ye shall henceforth, return no more that way(Deut. 17:16). It occurs three times in Scripture, and according to the Sages: 'In three places the Torah warns Israel not to return to Egypt; but three times they returned, and three times they were punished(The first time was in the days of Sennacherib - Isa 31:1); the second time was in the days of Johanan, the son of Keneah - Jer 42:16; the third time was in the days of Trajan. These three times they returned, and on each of these three occasions they came to grief). The first of the three warnings we have already mentioned; the second is contained in His words, [And the Lord shall bring three back into Egypt in ships,] by the way whereof I said unto thee: 'Thou shalt see it no more again(Deut. 28:68)', and the third in His words, Whereas ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more for ever(Ex. 14:13). Although [this third verse] according to its plain meaning is a statement, it is traditinally understood as a prohibition. At the end of the Gemara of Sukkah it is explained that Alexandria is included among the places in which we are forbidden to settle, and that the whole of the land of Egypt, in which we may not live, is an area of 400 square parasangs measured form the sea at Alexandria. It is, however, permissble to traverse this area for purposes of commerce, or to pass through it on the way to another country. It is said explicitly in the Jerusalem Talmud: 'You are not to return to settle, but you may return for purposes of trade, business, and conquest of the country.' NOTE it must be remembered that Maimonides lived in a time of persecution, when moreover the Crusades had engulfed the whole of the Near East. In such circustances, his decision to settle in Egypt was fully justified by the principle of the saving of human life, which is a paramount cinsideation in Jewish law."

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to exercise freedom of though so far as to accept opinions contrary to those taught us by the Torah; we are, on the contrary, to circumscribe our thoughts, and to raise a fence around them, which consists of the Positive and Negative Commandments of the Torah. This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), And that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray(Num. 15:39), on which the Sifre says: 'And that ye go not about after your own heart - this means heresy, as it is said, And I find more bitter than death[the woman] whose heart is snares and nets](Ecc.7:26]. And after your eyes - this means whoredom, as it is said, And Samson said unto his father: ['Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.'](Lit.,'she pleaseth my eyes'. Judges 14:3; Nym. 15:39, Sifre). By 'whoredom' is meant pursuing physical pleasures and indulgences, and constantly thinking about such things."

It is contained in His words(exalted be He), Thou shalt make no covenant with them(Deut. 6:2). We have already explained, in dealing with Positive Commandment 187, that the war against the Seven Nations, and the other injunctions relating to them, are proper to be included [in the 613 Commandments], and are not [to be excluded as being] limited in time.

This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), Thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth(Deut. 20:16). To slay them is a Positive Commandment, as we have explained in dealing with Positive Commandment 187. Whoever contravenes this prohibition, by failing to slay any of them whom he could have slain, thereby infringes a Negative Commandment. "

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to show mercy to the idolaters, or to praise anything belonging to them. It is contained in His words(exalted be He), Nor shalt thou show mercy into them (lo technonem)(Deut 7:2), which is traditionally interpreted as meaning: 'Thou shalt ascribe no grace (chen) to them.' Thus, even if an idolater has a fine figure, we are forbudden to say of him 'He has a fine figure', or 'he has a beautiful face', as is explained in our Gemara. The Gemara of Abolah Zarah in the Jerusalem Talmud says that to acscribe beauty [to an idolater] is forbidden by a Negative Commandment. NOTE as to those modern nations whose religion is derived from the Torah, and who believe in the Creator, in the Divine Revelation of the Law and in the sacredness of this Scripture, we are enjoined to promote their welfare to the utmost of our ability, to intercede on their behalf in our prayers, and to behave towards them in all secular relations as if they were linked to our faith. Judaism regards them as ultimately destined to embrace fully the 'Yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven and of the Commandments'."

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to suffer idolaters to dwell in our land, so that we may not learn their heresy. It is contained in His words (exalted be He), They shall not dwell in thy land - lest they make thee sin against Me(Ex. 23:33). Should an idolater desire to stay in our land, we may not permit him to do so unless he forswears idolatry; in which case it is permissible for him to become a resident. Such a one is known as a ger tosahv(a rsident alien or proselyte), which means that he is a proselyte only in the sense that he is allowed to dwell in our land. Thus the Sages say: 'Whi is a ger toshav? According to R.Judah, one who dorswears idolatry.' 'A worshipper of idols, however, may not dwell among us; neither are we to sell him an estate or rent him [land or houses]: ['lo techonem'](Deut 7:2) is expressly interpreted to mean, thou shalt not grant them a settlement (chaniyah) in the land.' The provisions of this Commandment are explained in Sanhedrin and Abodah Zarah. "
