The purpose of this is to deter us from making images altogether, so that we should not think, as the masses do, that they possess supernatural powers. This prohibition is contained in His words (exalted be He), Ye shall not make with Me - god of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.(Exodus 20:20). In explanation of this prohibition the Mechilta says: 'Gods of silver...ye shall not make: lest you should say: I am going to make them merely for ornaments, as others do in various countries, Scripture says, 'Ye shall not make unto you'. Transgression of this Negative Commandment is punishable by whipping. The provisions of this Commandment - what figures we are permitted and forbidden to fashion, and in what maneer, and so forth - are explained in the third chapter of Abodah Zarah. It is explained in Sanhedrin that this Negative Commandment - that is,  His words, Ye shall not make with Me - gods of silver, etc. - also embraces other matters which go beyond the scope of these Commandments; but the literal sense of the verse is what we have set out, as explained in the Mechilta.

    "title": "Bowing down to an idol",
    "text": "By this probition we are forbidden to bow down to an idol; and it is clear that the trm 'idol' means any object of worship other than the Lord. This prohibition is contained in His words (exalted be He), Thou shall not bow down unto them, nor serve them(Exodus 20:5). The intention is not to prohibit only the act of bowing down, to the exclusion of other [forms of worship]; only one of the modes of worship, namely, bowing down, is mentioned, but we are equally forbidden to sacrifice, [or pour a libation], or burn incense before an idol; and whoever does one of these forbidden things, i.e. who bows down, or sacrifices, or pours a libation, or burns incense [before an idol], is liable to stoning. The Mechilta says: 'He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed.'(Exodus 22:19) We have thus heard the penalty, but we have not heard the admonition. Scripture therefore says, Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them. Sacrificing, which is included [among the forbidden acts], is here singled out for special mention to teach us the following lesson: In the case of sacrifice, which is something that is performed in the worship of God, it is a sin [to perform it for an idol] whether [the  idol] is ordinarily worshipped in that manner or not; so also in the case of any other act which is performed in the service of God, it is a sin [to perform it for an idol], whether [the idol] is ordinarily worshipped in that manner or not. The meaning of this dictum is that whoever performs before an idol any one of these four acts of worship - namely, bowing down, sacrificing, burning incense, and pouring a libation - which we are under obligation to perform in the service of God, is liable to stoning, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner. This is what is meant by the expression 'not ordinarily worshipped': although one has not worshipped the idol in the manner in which it is customary to worship it, yet worshipping it in one of the ways mentioned renders him liable to stoning if he has sinned wilfully, and to the extinction if his sin was not witnessed or he has not been punished for it. If, however, the sin is committed unintentionally, the sinner must offer a fixed Sin-offering. This applies also to one who deifies any object whatever. (As e.g. one who picks up a brick and says, 'Thou are my god'). This prohibition - that is, the prohibition against doing homage to an idol by any one of these four modes of worship, even if the idol is not ordinarily worshipped in that manner - is repeated in His words (exalted be He), And they shall no more sacrifice their sactifices unto the satyrs(se-irim)(Leveticus 17:7), on which the Sifra says: 'Se-irem means demons. In the Gemara of Zebahim it is explained that this prohibition applies particularly to the case of one who slaughters a sacrifice to an idol, even if it is not ordinarily worshipped in that way: 'How do we know that if one sacrifices an animal to Merkulis(i.e. Mercury, the Roman divinity, who was customarily worshipped by throwing stones to his statue) he is liable to punishment? Because it is written, They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs. Since [this verse] is redundant in regard to the ordinarily manner of worship, [which is forbidden] by the verse [Take heed (See text of Neg. Comm. 193) to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them...saying,] 'How used these nations to serve their gods?[even so will I do likewise]'(Deut. 12:30), take it as referring to an abnormal manner of worship. Hence wilful contravention of this prohibition is punishable by both extinction and stoning, as explained above, and whoever transgresses it unintentionally must bring an offering. The relevant words of Scripture are: He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed. The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin. "

This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), Nor serve them (Ex 20:5), on which the Mechilta says: Thou shalt not bow down unto them, nor serve them: they are two separate and independent sins - offering a sacrifice and bowing down. Accordingly, one who throws a stone to [Baal] Peor or excretes to Merekulis is not guilty of sin, since these are not customary modes of worship to be included under His words(exalted be He), [Take heed to thyself...that thou enquire not after their gods, saying:] How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.(Deit. 12:30). Wilful contravention of this prohibition is punishable bt stoning and extinction, and one who violets it unontentionally must bring an offering. The provisions of this Commandment also are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin, where we read: Why is extinction thrice [mentioned as the punishment for] idolatry(Lev.20:3,5; Num. 15:31). It is prescibed once for [worshipping an idol in] the customary manner; once for [worshipping it in] a non-customary manner; and once for [for worship of] Molech. That is to say, one who worships any idol in any way whatever is liable to extinction, provided that the manner of worship is the cutomary one, such as excreting to [Baal] Peor, or throwing a stone to Merkulis, or removing one's hair before Chemosh(Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites - 1 Kings 11:7). Similarly, one who worships any idol whatever in any one of the four specified ways is liable to extinction, even if the manner of worship is not the cutomary one, as if one sacrifices to [Baal] Peor, or bows down to Merkulis -  which would be a 'non-customary' manner of worship. The third[Scriptural mention of] extinction applies to one who causes his offspring to pass through the fire in the worship of Molech, as I shall explain[in connection with the next Commandment]. "

The prohibition of such conduct is repeated in His words There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire(Deut 18:10).

The prohibition of this practice is in the words, Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits(yidde'oni)(Lev. 19:31). This is not to be regarded as lav she-bik'laluth[in which case the prohibitions of the practices of the ob and of the yidde'oni would count only as one Negative Commandment.

    "title": "Studying idolatrous practices",
    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to take an interest in idolatry or study its practices: that is, to learn by enquiry the follies and superstitions taight by its founders, as for instance that a certain spirit can be brought down by such-and-such means, and will behave in such-and-such a way; or that if incense is burnt to a certain star, and the worshippers stand before it in such-and-such a position, it will act in a certain manner; and the like. Merely thinking about these matters, and enquiring into these illusions, leads fools to frequent idols and worship them. The Scriptural verse containing the prohibition of these practices is: Turn ye not unto the idols(Lev. 19:4), on which the Sifra says: 'If you turn after them you make them gods'. The Sifra also quotes R.Judah as saying: '[Turn ye not unto the idols] - turn ye not to see them.': that is to say, do not even look at the physical idol, or study its craftmanship, so as not to spen a moment on anything connected with it. In [Tractate Shabbath], chapter Sheol Adam, the Sages say: 'The writing under the painting or an image may not be read on the Sabbath. And as for the image itself, one must not look at it even on weekdays(This applies only to pictures used in idol-worship), because it is said, Turn ye not unto the idols. How is this to be understood? Said R.Johanan: Turn ye not unto that which is conceived in your own minds.' This prohibition of thinking about idols is repeated in His words, Take head to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside and serve [other gods](Deut 11:16). That is to say, if your mind falls into the error of thinking about idols, this will lead you to stray from the right path, and actually worship them. He further says on this same matter, Lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, etc(Deut. 4:19). For He does not forbid the mere raising the head and observing the heavenly bodies with the eyes; what he forbids is looking with eye of the mind at what their worshippers attribute to them. So also His words: [Take heed to thyself...] that thou enquire not after their gods, saying: 'How used these nations to serve theor gods? even so will I do likewise(Deut. 12:30), are an admonition to us not to enquire after the manner of their worship, even though we do not worship them ourselves, because all this leads to going astray after them. You must know that whoever transgresses this prohibition is liable to whipping?(This applies only where an overt act is involved, as where the idol is covered and the person concerned removes its veil in order to look at it). This is made clear at the end of the first chapter of Erubin, in connection with the ruling that the penalty of whipping for breach of the laws of erub of Boundaries(Neg.Comm 321) is prescribed by Scriptural law. In support of this the Scriptural words, Let no(al) man go out of his place[on the seventh day] were cited(Ex16:29); and when an objector asked, 'Is whipping the punishment for breach of a prohibition expressed by al and not by lo?' he was met with the reply: 'If whipping were not the punishment for breach of a prohibition expressed by al, it would follow that the breach of the prohibition Turn ye not(al) unto the idols, would not be punishable by whipping[but in fact it is]. This shows that contravention of this prohibition is punishable by whipping."

This prohibition is contained in His words(exalted be He), And make no mention of the name of other gods(Ex.23:13) (meaning), 'You may not cause the idolater to swear by his deity'. The Mechilta also say in the same place, 'And make no mention [of the name of other gods] - this means that one may not make a vow in the name of an idol'. In Sanhedrin it is said: 'And make no mention(of the name of other gods) - this means that one may not say to his friend, Wait for me at the place of such-and-such and idol.' Whoever transgresses this prohibition - that is, swear by any created object which misguided people have come to regard as a deity, as though it were a superior being - is liable to whipping. The Gemara of Sanhedrin says, in connection with the Rabbinical prohibition of kissing or embracing an idol, or sweeping the floor before it, and similar actions indicating respect and love for it: 'For none of these actions is the offender whipped(The reason being that they are all included in one general prohibition (Turn ye not unto the idols-Lev.19:4), for which no punishment is prescibed), except for vowing or swearing by the name of an idol.' The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the seventh chapter of Sanhedrin.

Scripture does not contain a precise and specific prohibition on this matter, that is, a prohibition of prophesying in the name of an idol; but Scripture prescribed the punishment, namely death, for this offence in His words(exalted be He), [The prophet...] that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die(Deut. 18:20). This death is by strangulation, because we have a general tule that where Scripture prescibes the death penalty without more precise definition, strangulation is intended. You are already acquainted with the rule which I have explained to you in connection with the fourteenth of the Principles set out in the Introduction to this work - the rule laid down by the Sages in the words: 'Scripture never prescribes a punishment without first stating a prohibition.' Now [in the case under consideration] the prohibition is to be derived from the words: Make no mention of the name of other gods(Ex. 23:13; See Neg.Comm.14); for it is not impossible that a single Negative Commandment should serve as the admonitory warning for a number of prohibitions, and yet should not constitute a lav she-bik'laluth(See Neg.Comm 9. The verse Make no mention, etc, is made to serve as the admonitory basis of both Neg.Comm 14 and the Commandment now under consideration), since a separate punishment is laid down in each case. I will give you illustrations of this principle in due course. The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin."

    "title": "Prophesying falsely",
    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to prohecy falsely: that is, to utter in the name of the Lord a prophecy which the Lord(exalted be He) has not spoken, or has spoken to someone other than him who arrogates it to himself and says falsely that the Lord has spoken it to him. This Negative Commandment is contained in His words, But the prophet shall speak a word presumptuously in My name,  which I have not commanded him to speak, [or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die](Deut. 18:20). In this case also the punishment for contravention of the prohition is strangulation: the Talmud includes 'a false prophet' in the list of transgressors who are to be strangled. It also says in the same place: 'Three are liable to death by the hand of man: [the prophet] that shall speak presumptuously in My name means one who prophesies what he has not heard(i.e. the prophecy itself is altogether fictitious); which I have not commanded, meansone who prophesies what was not spoken to him; or that shall speak in the name of other gods means one who prophesies in the name of an idol. Concerning all of them it is written, that same prophet shall die; and wherever the death penalty is decreed in Scripture without specification [of the method], strangulation is intended. The provisions of the law regarding a false prophet are explained in the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin. NOTE As interpreted in Jewish tradition, the meaning of these verses is as follows: 'As to calamities predicted by a prophet - as when, for example, he foretells the death of a certain individual or states that in a certain year there will be famine or war, and so forth -  the non-fulfillment of his forecast does not disprove his prophetic standing...For God is long-suffering and abounding in kindness, and repents of the evil[He has threatened]. It may also be that [those who were admonished] repented and were forgiven, as happened to the people of Nineveh. Possibly, too, the execution of the sentence is only deferred, as in the case of Hezekiah. But if the prophet[in the name of the Lord] foretells good fortune, declaring that a definite event will come to pass to pass, and the benefit promised is not realized, he is unquestionably a false prphet. For no blessing, decreed by the Almighty, even if promised conditionally, is ever revoked."

    "text": "By this prohibition we are forbidden to listen to the prophecy of one who prophesies in the name of an idol; that is, we may not engage in controvrsy with him, or ask him questions, saying to him, 'What is thy miracle and what is thy proof of this matter?' as we should do in the case of one who prophesies in the name of the Lord. When we hear a person prophesying in the name of an idol, we must warn him, just as it is our duty to warn every sinner, and if he persists in his claim, we must mete out to him the punishment which he deserves in accordance with Scriptural law, paying no heed to his miracles or his proofs. The prohibition on this matter is contained in His words(exalted be He), Thou shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet(Deut. 13:4). The provisions of this Commandment are explained in the eleventh chapter of Sanhedrin. "
